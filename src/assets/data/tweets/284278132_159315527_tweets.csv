"The things I've thought about most often when considering a career in real estate:

- If you can't find the one you're looking for, you should probably consider renting

- If something is difficult for you, you should consider looking at a different approach

These are small amounts to spend on yourself but they're a lot to swallow and you can probably handle them with restraint

So you don't need to spend all your effort looking for happiness in gold and pearls. Just try to be as effortless as you can. #rental #rentaltextileum"
"It’s so meaningful to see black business owners across the country come to America and sell pounds to support Black entrepreneurs.

I support commonsense capital gains taxes on dividends, and am willing to bet the cash I receive will go to people who need it most."
