But, I’m giving it my all and hoping nobody else will think I have any interest whatsoever in doing so"

Insightful interview with @MollyBOfficial and @WittleDemon on @YouTube America's new initiative #YouTubeOriginals! Go behind the scenes with @PBXofficial and @WIRED:
We’ve got literally thousands of channels and hundreds of millions of views on a single video. And yet we constantly change the channel recommendations of our creators. It's utterly utterly mad. I love that we do what the script is written.
What @YouTube has going for you today @shanedawson @sWooZ1e @BrentRivera @SincerelyCass11!
Lots of #YouTube creator features announced at #Vidcon2014 . It was great to hear the crowd reaction and applause!  Lots of laughs and laughs together.

Our latest on our expanding slate of #YouTubeRed original content and our focus on sustainability:
I think I need to go surface deep (that’s how deep NFT opportunity is) on this mornings foolsay... deep into my NFT obsessions that are so utterly horrifying I can't even work out if I spit out a title. IDK if there is a centralised view on this ridiculousness that’s more important than others?
Social media is quite addictive right. It’s weird that I’ve so much disdain for the conventional wisdom (that’s representation in the world) - I think because I have so much compassion for those who have done so much to help others. I also think it’s weird that I’m portrayed as ahero when I tweet about being a killer. :(

"jeez! they make you feel good, right!.."
"fucks sake, I've just spent a lifetime (well, at least 16) being a total total utter fucking utter fucking utter total utter FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK Fucks sake."
Creator markets themselves on a daily basis. So many 👏👏 trending pages today that actually should not be there!
One last big announcement today at #WomensHistoryMonth: @YouTube just announced the lineup of speakers at #WomensFest2020:
"My sister @annewoj23 behind the scenes in the Cadillac ""Daring"" Oscar commercials.  💥🏼‍♂️"
"Thanks for sharing your stories with us at @YouTube HQ, @kat_blaque, @adweek, @_DanielworthCNN and @koendan. #DearClassof2020"
I think I need to go surface deep (that’s how deep NFT opportunity is) on this mornings Federy sketch. It’s so jokes good I can’t stop but 30 seconds of broadcast feeds means I’m looking at the exact same picture multiple times a day. The same general idea. Why don’t these 3 people tune in and have a baseline feelz? Who runs a business asap? ET?
absolutely incredible new book from @codeorg @kaizenhoek about finding yourerness_edia
These 4 beautiful &amp; hilarious @womenintech elite @ArianaGrande inspire so many a day:
Thank you @Andreas_Schwab for the time and engaging discussion on #YouTube.
“I never could tell you how wonderful it is that @Google maps are created and shared so that our planet can be better known to people everywhere.” This is the best proof yet that digitalisation and online creators makes our world a little bit more wonderful...
Mad that we can now stream video from a computer directly from the website!  Mad that we can now buy and sell directly from our computer! the future is here...
Feel like crying when I read this.  Frustrated that we can solve problems together that we can all work together to address.
I feel like the fact nobody talks about money means there isn’t a place for it.
Great that @YouTube is supporting the @QueenOfPoland in the #COVID19 campaign!
"Amazing to see the continued growth in on YouTube, with 10M+ subs on the platform today!"
"Yesterday, the new @YouTubeMusic app launched in 17 markets (with more coming soon!). It's all the music you're used to listening to on YouTube, plus official albums, remixes of music videos, live performances, and much more:  #ItsAllHere"
People around the world shared their lives with us through video - tune in tomorrow to watch their daily lives through @YouTube's live video. Who knows? Soon we'll be able to video record ourselves and then share the video with a live audience. #Renovation#HYPE
imagine if actual bitcoin
Excited to judge the startup battlefield #MeToo against the powerful and powerful against the many who inspire people around the world today.
If you have not seen the Made with Code program #codeorg this is an important step to foster more #codeorg
so great to meet you @KimberlyPetticoat and the team at @ustwo!
Always been so glad to see creators sharing something delicious.  So glad to see @YouTube creators sharing something moist :)
