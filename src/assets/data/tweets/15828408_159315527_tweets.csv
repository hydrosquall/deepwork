I was pitching to a startup founder with B2B sales who was pitching to a beauty brand with a 5% chance of success.  She said she couldn't get a 5% chance on the product she was pitching on, so she pitched Amazon. She lost her bid on the product and was told she couldn't do business with the brand. She took it back and is working to make it happen! She is very grateful to me for advising her on how to make this happen!"
