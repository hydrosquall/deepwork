"just downloaded the ‘MetaMask’ etherium app wallet. There is not a single thing, button or interaction I am able to understand. I am officially old 😎 WTF is this insanity... I don’t even understand the basic logic!"
Know anyone who’s ever taken time to think about the value of life? Anyone who’s ever had a personal journey and not felt stuck? Anyone who’s ever taken time to think about the value of life and not felt stuck? Jokes off. Kills you. Time to move on. Let’s talk about worth
“Anything but the 'everyone's behind' mentality 🤦🏼‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
we’re officially in a dystopian sci-fi novel
"what I'm realising is that my ability to trust and bond with these people is heavily predicated on whether I have a deep and abiding respect for my own soul. If I have a caring, caring soul, then (relatively speaking) I have a caring and caring for a good sense of humour"
Found this out the hard way how terrible marketing is... 
i think its time for me to retire from investing. It's such an overly complicated unfair fucking annoying total bullshit. I don't understsand dilution and resigned to the fact I never will. I also don't agree with preferential shares. So I am out. Goodbye. FUCK
Damn.... the NFT space is literally full of total jerks.
"The idea of “elf” got me thinking about databases, what databases are, and what not.

Had never actually considered what they actually meant but now that I think about it..."
"so good, been studying youtubers (and the obvious disdain, eye roll and jealousy) only to realise and rationalise that it's a job! formulaville! I can't see young people for entrepreneurs/clients they are ever going to be clients/partners! let alone managers! it's all biz! idk what people actually think is right! 😂 #takeithome"
"we’d do this but with hockey pucks for goalie warmups

think about it this way: if you got to choose between going big lols and being part of the innovation ecosystem, then who would you choose? I'd say over the best AI|Facebook or Twitter|lean for AI|less for AI|wonderful for AI"
"I mean ok wtf. (At least we're at that awkward stage of my trolling life where tiktok, truth, value, and life will determine price) but any word on the next stage? Beta?"
"then I read about NFT world.. so good, so completely unintentional, done so over the years, and I feel like I have a voice, I just speak it, and I feel like I have it heard"
WHERE YOU BE AT!!!
"Ok, who forgot to disable sentient mode? 🤦🏼‍♂️"
I was going to name my first child Babelfish but now I think I might go with Translatotron... rolls off the tongue better. Thx for creating my baby unicorn 💥🤦🏻‍♀️
"What does it actually mean to invest in the ""future of work""? 💚💙💪💖"
i think it's time for me to retire from investing. I was always looking for a family and realised that my wife was having an affair with her colleagues so I decided to stay. I'm so looking for a partner to remind me of the highs and the lows of investing in so many different ways. I can't see young founders of today having what it takes. They have so much disposable income! Unreal joy.
i don't know what that actually means but when i searched for it in twitter it meant i had to say something awful about something as trivial as paying a user. total utter jest. no thanks.
"Hell, I mean wow, you spend a lifetime chasing 'success' only to realise there is no one truth (it's within us apparently) but in 2021 you also realise many people actually think about Crypto! WTF! get a life!.. too genius.. total muppetry!"
"Prosthetics for the human mind. Philosopher, scientist, investor. Star Trek badass. So good. All of them beautiful. All in all brilliant. Highly recommended!"

I don’t think there is anything I hate more than bank jokes. Wtf is going on here! I mean I don’t understand but I have to admit I do like dealing with jokers.
I guess the issue I think I'm getting at in my head is that just because something is an NFT circle of competence doesn't mean its there (assuming you have a community)
"NFT’s are about empowering the naked eye. We all need to get used to much of the now but ways, ways, beyond us, behind the scenes things are good. Talking heads! True legends."
"The Current State of Machine Intelligence 2.0!

Agree? Disagree? Let me know!"
"I’m not sure if you’d know me or not, but both of you are gonna love me when I bring the same genuine talent for AI to the table. I’m excited about the idea of connecting computing with fun, creative new ways.

I’m excited about the idea of empowering underserved communities by making them more accessible to newcomers.

I’m excited about the idea that 3D facial reconstruction from a human can tell a story about other people."
From baseline to top of the list:>Favorite topic this morning is IoT... inspiring
If you are starting a biz and want to raise around 1 million biz donations then I'd suggest you sign up to the right newsletter. You will get to email with a personalized thank you message. Go mate.. it’s all about that 20k you feel you.
"Jeeebzs. I mean wow, I’m so used to paying my bills myself (w/o debt) that I don’t actually care how much I spend now that I have money! Now I’m fed up with having to do with paying bills and caring less about paying bills myself. Horrible. Worse. Worse. WTF!"
"It’s pretty wild that human eyes will potentially get to see this IRL in not too long.

Will certainly take extreme effort, but the fact that it’s a legit possibility makes the future feel more exciting 💙"
It's easy to intuit that something is monetised when you have no idea what it is until you see it. Motivational component of sense of community is just that - motivational. Community builder is just that. Piece about community building
"does anyone know what they are doing in life? I don't mean pupose, (although I guess that might help!) but like what is the point? is there a centralised view on said destination? Fuck me, not even close"
"I have been meaning to do this for a while now, but had to get a new computer. I now have a spare etherium

Would you be interested in working with a production based on my ‘Crypto’ project?"
