"what I'm realising is that my ability to trust and bond with these people is heavily predicated on whether I have a deep and abiding respect for my own soul. If I have a caring, caring soul, then (relatively speaking) I have a caring and caring for a good sense of humour"
Found this out the hard way how terrible marketing is... 
Damn.... the NFT space is literally full of total jerks.

I'm so looking for a partner to remind me of the highs and the lows of investing in so many different ways. I can't see young founders of today having what it takes. They have so much disposable income! Unreal joy.

"Jeeebzs. I mean wow, I’m so used to paying my bills myself (w/o debt) that I don’t actually care how much I spend now that I have money! Now I’m fed up with having to do with paying bills and caring less about paying bills myself. Horrible. Worse. Worse. WTF!"
It's easy to intuit that something is monetised when you have no idea what it is until you see it. Motivational component of sense of community is just that - motivational. Community builder is just that. Piece about community building
"I have been meaning to do this for a while now, but had to get a new computer. I now have a spare etherium
