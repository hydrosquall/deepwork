"A lot of people hate on college. 

They think if you only went to college you'd be a baller .

Not me. 

I came to the realization that even though I'm from a pretty bigy pastiche, college isn't for me.

It's not for me. 

It sucks. 

What should I do?"
I really need to check in on my chakra of belonging. I don't actually have a clue how that works but I feel like I need to. Perhaps in due course I learn as much about myself and my work ethic as possible. I don't actually have a clue but I wanna!
"such a legend that no matter what I do, he stays true to the brand and is never changing. The true joy of all this is that he keeps on coming."
"excited for next week (note I have not started) - early access, open rates, so many things that make me love it all.

1. The idea that you donâ€™t actually know how to code is so powerful, so fascinating, so utterly fascinating.

2. I love it when people tell you how they are getting into investing, or even suggesting you do, itâ€™s like learning about the car industry, or about going to see a vintage dealership.

3. Itâ€™s fun"
ALL I DO IS WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN NO MATTER WHAT I DO
FUCK! I am on fire! ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²
"You have to write 100% fucking great essays.

I literally don't get it! or my inability to is not any cluess what I am saying but I am desperate. So I am. So out of this gushing ball of bile I am hunting for horses who are not cowboys or who actually look like dummies. Fucks sake! get 'em! (get me! what am I actually doing here?) not dummies! people who actually look like dummies! who actually look like I mean wtf! who actually use twitter? who actually build actual hids of content? "
"Love this story. 

I donâ€™t know why I would but I like it to sound odd. 

So, I made a video. 

Whatâ€™s a cool thing I can do now?

- Tell a funny story ~ good if the narrator is a total nutter
- Use common sense and experience
- Build community
- Enjoy your time with family and friends
- Whatever. 

Thank you for the reminder."
Jeeez Iâ€™m literally the ultimate actual creator. I mean fuck me thatâ€™s the dream! You can be whatever you want to be when you grow up!
"i'm happy with my life.

But honestly...what am I happy with?

What is my problem?"
There is nothing more fucking annoying than filling out a fucking form. But more annoying than filling out a fucking document.
That was the most fun day of my life to date. It was everything. Iâ€™d literally forgotten how amazing it is
A big reason why I invested (or never invested) in the first place is that I love it. The customer service is top notch. Anyone whoâ€™s ever bought a drink in a store has been disqualified from the store. Thatâ€™s a genuinuine example of pure evil. Defiant.
"I'd actually like to imagine being an actual human. Weird. Weird. Kind of mad how itâ€™s taken me this long to actually understand the human condition. I mean fuck me Iâ€™m a human (well, maybe not) but Iâ€™m so dumb. I canâ€™t even work out what I mean by human!"
"The investment game is so unbelievably simple. Take risks and be scared. Trust me, I am realistic. 

There are so many options for investing in the space. 

Here are some... I haven't researched them all. 

But they're the most popular right?"
The biz of today is a thing of the past. Value add. No fucking adverts! None! Fuck that! Iâ€™m now marketing to unlock more cash to the people who can afford it. Itâ€™s gonna be big. People will want to know how they can make do with so much cash!
"FUCK! what a joker. so good. so good. he actually ends up using drugs to get into Harvard. A whole lot of different drugs! I mean, that's a lot of different drugs! Some of which are likely to be very successful. (See: opioid, epicatec, and venlaf!!)

But the #1 drug he talks about most about is alcohol. And itâ€™s totally non-toxic!"
"I now have the first piece of Twitter art in my ipad.

Itâ€™s a simple circle."
"I am very proud of me. Utter legend.

I have beaten so much more confident athletes.

But I have had some of the biggest impact."
"I am uneasy sharing this but its good. So here goes (I will soon):

a) I am a weirdo. I love weird. And very rarely do people assume I am not capable of being weird. (Being weird is a fancy way of saying not able to handle things that are huge and life decisions that take longer than you think!)
b) this. is awesome. I can talk about how I love my wife (she is an amazing person) and how I got to where I am now but this is my chance to share about my amazing wife + business.
c) Any fucking rooms?"
Mad new exciting fucking wow shit new stuff here ðŸ™‹
"I donâ€™t understand why anyone keeps money - even if itâ€™s a lot! I mean, I understand itâ€™s silly! I mean, I understand that itâ€™s not really fun! Maybe itâ€™s just not fun at all!"
"one thing I have learned over the course of my 5 years is that just about nobody is good at anything. It's easy to be a$$ from doing anything. And it's not hard to do good when you have the proper training, motivation, and control."
Something I have noticed many people asking me this: how can I get my kids to go to a famous city and have them join me on a trip?
"Fuck! Adhd! It's literally so good. 

First off: your phone is supposed to be free! Why is that? A present for one? 

Second: if you buy an NFT to give to someone, do you know what that means? I mean, I can't see that as anything but good. Just...differentative...?"
"Of all the ads I have seen on YouTube, none have gotten more than a skim. Shockingly, none have gotten more than a click! Wow!"
"It feels like 100 years since I've used a lot of alcohol.

And since then, the tolerance for alcohol has gotten so bad... my friends... I canâ€™t stay sober. 

Crazy."
"What an incredible world we are living in TEDxMiami.

Talked personal finance from start to finish.

Will tell stories of how he kept his cool.

Hard work, smarts.

Not sure what that actually means.

What are some other cool things I should know about??

Also wanna mention my company's fan base, which is really fun.

Wish Iâ€™d met them all the time.

Knowing who they are, what they do, and what they learned."
