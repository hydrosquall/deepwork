i'm not raising a problem of twitter or bizstrapping (although of course it is!) but 1. is it good to have 2 ways of disclosing your status: as a secret or as a public one? (wiki or piece of shit?) and 2. is it better to have a set status or a set status for each? answers by Ken (@thekeeperof secretscurity)
I hate myself for being such a perfectionist. The world is so hazy now.. complete with no clear destination. I am so used to it. It's just been me. Having fun. Having jokers. Having.. I don’t even know why I do it but having jokers is the game is so hideous. Why? Because I am a game. And there is no winner.
I remember twice a year the brilliant people at @IbrahimKamara_ did what @rahim_kamara did: they destroyed. They destroyed their own plan B. They also showed us how to build something from the ground up.  Remembering those who passionately believed in the hype free @IbrahimKamara instagram page.
