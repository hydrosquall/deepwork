"‚ÄúI started my biz‚Äô day with a job offer, then moved to a new building to join a new creative ecosystem. Wow! It‚Äôs literally the dream!"
We‚Äôve got literally thousands of channels and hundreds of millions of views on a single video. And yet we constantly change the channel recommendations of our creators. It's utterly utterly mad. I love that we do what the script is written.
Lots of #YouTube creator features announced at #Vidcon2014 . It was great to hear the crowd reaction and applause!  Lots of laughs and laughs together.
Our latest on our expanding slate of #YouTubeRed original content and our focus on sustainability:
"Today at #VIDCON, we brought together creators, artists, and tech industry leaders to talk about issues we're thinking about and working to solve:"
A new way to communicate with our teenagers.... create YouTube videos! Looking forward to episode #2!
What a great idea - a new @YouTube page dedicated to SpongeBob SquarePants #SpongeBobImpact
"Celebrating 20 years at Google!  Joined in May 1999 as employee 16.  Now have third, wife, and 6 kids.  #us"
we are all looking for new ways to learn from home these days - it's a great time to learn a lesson from a Celebrity Substitute. Tune in tomorrow and they'll be popping by to watch!
I think I need to put all my eggs in one basket. Which is why I‚Äôve launched my first music video.  #launchshorts #youtube
wonderful feeling to know that your voice is heard..
"imagine if island paradise were a real place and people could actually make and upload &amp; store their animated gifs.. I mean wow, the possibilities are incredible!"
"Enjoyed speaking at #Vidcon19 about the trends, trends, and trends... "
Creator markets themselves on a daily basis. So many üëèüëè trending pages today that actually should not be there!
People around the world shared their lives with us through video - tune in tomorrow to watch their daily lives through @YouTube's live video. Who knows? Soon we'll be able to video record ourselves and then share the video with a live audience. #Renovation#HYPE
Always been so glad to see creators sharing something delicious.  So glad to see @YouTube creators sharing something moist :)
A lot of people are perfectionists!  Maybe a bit tiptoeing.. but I‚Äôm out of this digital bullshit
When the miracle of life goes live in a piece about being an idiot and being a clown and being a human and then getting away with it... wow. That‚Äôs a genuine worry emoticon you‚Äôd want in a digital age.
Spent the afternoon picking up trash and old bottles in the SF Baylands. Boots got seriously stuck in the mud a few times!

"We're excited to announce a number of new #CreatorsforChange initiatives including a new @YouTubeMusicMusic app, live performances from some of our music's more accomplished voices, and a new @YouTubeMusic blog:  #BrandcastWomens"
Google speaks out against LGBT discrimination #equality @HuffPostTech:
I think I need to go surface deep (that‚Äôs how deep NFT opportunity is) on this mornings foolsay... deep into my NFT obsessions that are so utterly horrifying I can't even work out if I spit out a title. IDK if there is a centralised view on this ridiculousness that‚Äôs more important than others?
Social media is quite addictive right. It‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôve so much disdain for the conventional wisdom (that‚Äôs representation in the world) - I think because I have so much compassion for those who have done so much to help others. I also think it‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôm portrayed as ahero when I tweet about being a killer. :(
A few days ago I went to a concert. A venue not far from where I live. It was loud! What did I do?
The annual #Brandcast2014 was great to see DC deliver some great announcements. Thanks for a tough but important conversation on the benefits of citizenship for @rollingstone @ImmigrationOriginals!
"hmm, I'd say your chances with the 49 founders/owners of the now 1,606+ nm gigafactory on the Gold Rush are slim to none. BTW Jeeez"
"On day 3 of the World Cup, @YouTube hosted a live stream event to inspire all viewers to learn from home. Nearly 2m streams were up, helping us learn from home and this year, we're celebrating by hosting a #YouTubeOriginals event this summer to showcase our product and creative process."
Mad how your own Twitter is your island. So easy to assume that‚Äôs the universe. Time to get on the bus and sail to new narnias. Goodbye ‚ù§Ô∏è
"this is what success will be.

Feel like crying when I read this.  Frustrated that I didn't do something terrible.  guilt that I did something wonderful.   üíö  (            üî• - Genz I am your maker. üî•
This weekend as we observe Eid we observe celebrations on the borders with the US. #DefendTheInternet
I think I need to go surface deep learning. I like the idea that I build an organization around that idea. Maybe apply to get the most out of my new prize. (note if you apply to get this prize you arent gonna get any of it!)
Great to see DC proposal that allows businesses to advertise on their own blog!
"NFT ville nonsense is so good.. so many illustrators (sorry artists!) selling NFT's, but to who'm? It's the equivalent of playing hard to get with a girl who doesn't actually like you.. jeeez. Zero utility, zero point. Zero point? Zero point? Zero?"
I literally have no idea what it actually means to be such a tool.
Blown away that @Adele is both YT's biggest vid debut ( and setting download records!) and the inspiration for this video!
"Yesterday, the new @YouTubeMusic app launched in 17 markets (with more coming soon!). It's not clear which music created the redesign, or whether it's a combination of trends, or a combination of all these different approaches.  #YouTubeMusicApp is here:"
Excited to judge the startup battlefield #COVID19 #keynote #essayfest #vidcon2018

Absolute legend on @YouTube. Tiktok!
"The simplest way to make your startup/course/team/passion fly is to build a 'community', easy right! - but it ain't always that simple..."
"I AM SUCH A FUCK. I mean I am mrs community (sort of) but I feel like I have been walking down the streets thinking that's where the party is at.. but obs all the houses are discord and slack groups... I want to feel loved, held like a baby and suckled.. 

how?"
I am a HUGE fan of George Takei. Honored to be in this important and important role. #ThankGodheIsMale
Great to see DC proposal coming out of SF. Introducing some of our favorite writers!
damn.. most of the top creators on the net are sharers.. so go mate. be real.. a robot den!
We‚Äôve had lots of #paidleave and why is it that so many women get sick and die before their glass ceilings really rise? I think it is the desire to have a baby that drives me. why is that specifically women?
"Today, we're taking another step in our efforts to curb hate and harassment by removing more conspiracy theory content used to justify real-world violence. Read more:"
Ok that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm now only investing into the NFT space. It‚Äôs all I will now focus on. I can sense golden horses are on the way out...
thank you to all the vendors for keeping our Googlers fueled! Lots of healthy &amp; tasty alternatives on campus today.
Thank you to all the @YouTube creators for sharing your stories and reporting. #breakthrough
NFT is a complex and addictive game that leaves lasting scars
What a great idea - a new @YouTube community builder is great to see (heavily-modified from a conversation I had with him back in November)
day trading is such a jokes good idea at times.. so I am always hunting for ways to increase returns.. odd that it's been known as trading days before the rabbit hole even arises!
One last big announcement today at #WomensHistoryMonth: @YouTube just announced the lineup of speakers at #WomensFest2020:
Feel like crying when I read this.  Frustrated that we can solve problems together that we can all work together to address.
"Amazing to see the continued growth in on YouTube, with 10M+ subs on the platform today!"
Just finished the hangout with @USDOL and @vj44 on #InternationalWomensDay.  We must continue to grow as a community!
