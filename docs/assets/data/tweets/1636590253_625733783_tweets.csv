Roberts: 

...you get the idea.

I love your thoughtfulness and the need to learn from experience while doing something new.

...I get it. I have a hard time believing this...but never do 

classes.

Many people tell me they're getting the MBA or the CTO's job because of this.

Of course, most people don't think that's a good thing.

Why?

People who do it think it'll make them more successful.

Or, to put it another way: it'll make you less successful."

You’ll see why."
