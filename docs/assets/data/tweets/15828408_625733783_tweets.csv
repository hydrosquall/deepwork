So, if you have a problem, want me to help you out, or something, just email me!

And if you have a topic or two that I missed, feel free to leave a message!

"‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, our family ‚Äî my parents, dad and mom ‚Äî would take us to wonderful places in the world.‚Äù

And I'm happy, dedicated, funny, independent, warm, fuzzy no matter what!"
