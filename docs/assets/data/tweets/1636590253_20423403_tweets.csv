If you are enjoying the benefits of crypto-currency (eg. you don't hold any crypto-currencies) this is the pump/receipt to know your user fund is now up to £250K (aka £50K if you include investments) in value. That makes you a true money maker.
Looking forward to many future innovations by these bright developers in Singapore and Brazil!
Check this out. A Pakistani man used a bitcoin wallet and now makes millions from it. He claims he makes a living from it all. I ethically cannot accept this as true. What the fuck is this? Is this actually a thing?
iPhone photographers! This is going to be a great moment!
We are all more grateful than ever for the resilience and compassion of the human spirit. Wishing you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas 🌟

Mad times. The irony of life is we waste years simply re-creating ourselves and then we find out later that the original creator/owners of the original were drug users and alcoholics! So good to get back on the road to becoming better people.

Their courage and love of doing work toward a better world is a great example of us all that”must share in the success of others. #Dreamers — we are your friends and family. We are America’s future.❤️
Love so much that so many people are such good people. So much of our modern horseshit is actually controlled by these very same people.
Social media is quite addictive right. It’s weird that I’d usually get bollocked for being on my phone too much but the issue is the communication device is so good at making me want to touch!

Now that’s a bit of a maddening. We have so much going on in the world right now. What’s going on. What’s stopping humanity from gearing up for a manic breakdown in time?
Mad times. We’re so used to dealing with people (especially people who know us) who sound genuinely surprised (!) by our staff members' voices. This is a bit different. It’s actually actually better. You're actually sounding a bit much!
I don't have a clue about much but I love learning about said cluelessness. #WorldTeachersDay
